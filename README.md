Columbia IEOR4511 - Drug Discovery (HTR2A)

HTR2A (5-Hydroxytryptamine Receptor 2A) is a Protein Coding gene. Diseases associated with HTR2A include Major Depressive Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. Among its related pathways are Signaling by GPCR and Monoamine GPCRs. Gene Ontology (GO) annotations related to this gene include G protein-coupled receptor activity and drug binding. An important paralog of this gene is HTR2C.

This gene encodes one of the receptors for serotonin, a neurotransmitter with many roles. Mutations in this gene are associated with susceptibility to schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and are also associated with response to the antidepressant citalopram in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). MDD patients who also have a mutation in intron 2 of this gene show a significantly reduced response to citalopram as this antidepressant downregulates expression of this gene. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
